> Created my first branch today.  The goal of this branch is to fill in some content on my github page, and learn a bit about Git in the process.  Here we grow!

> Been a few days since I could make any updates.  Life has been quite busy.  Adding some static content to the page today.  Also updated some of the entries in the styles.css file.  But my focus right now is adding the content, and I'll work on the design and look later.

> Added some more content tonight.  Also made the decision to incorporate the W3.css framework to this project.  We will see how that goes!
